# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck.

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration**: Visualize sample images from the CIFAR-10 dataset to understand the nature of the images and their corresponding labels.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize pixel values of images to the range [0, 1] and convert class labels to one-hot encoded vectors.

3. **Model Definition**: Define a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using TensorFlow. The model architecture includes convolutional layers followed by batch normalization and dropout layers to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.

4. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model on the preprocessed CIFAR-10 training set using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. Monitor training performance on the validation set to prevent overfitting.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on the CIFAR-10 test set to measure its performance in terms of accuracy.

## Dropout and Batch Normalization
- **Dropout**: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops a fraction of the units (neurons) in the neural network during training. This helps prevent overfitting by forcing the network to learn redundant representations and reduces the reliance on specific units.
- **Batch Normalization**: Batch normalization normalizes the activations of each layer in the neural network by adjusting and scaling the inputs to have zero mean and unit variance. This helps stabilize and accelerate the training process, allows for higher learning rates, and reduces the dependence on initialization and hyperparameters.

By incorporating dropout and batch normalization layers into the model, we aim to improve its generalization and performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
